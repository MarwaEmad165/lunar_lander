# Lunar Lander Game

Lunar Lander is a physics-based game where you control a spaceship and attempt to land it safely on a designated target. Gravity continuously pulls the spaceship downward, and you must use thrusters to slow down and maintain balance. The objective is to land gently without crashing while conserving fuel.

## Features
- Realistic gravity simulation
- Thruster controls for movement and landing
- Fuel management for strategic gameplay
- Collision detection for landing success or failure
- Engaging challenge that tests precision and control

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:
```sh
pip install gymnasium
```
